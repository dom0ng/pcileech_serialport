# Anti-Cheats

This is very old project from year(s) ago.
This project was created to test current top Anti-Cheats against FPGA approach with minimal effort / knowledge with maximal success.

At his peak, count at least 2000-3000 actives users and probably still mass-abused today.
More than yearly run with this number was literally insane/ out of mind.

This project is currently unsafe on all chinese platform.
